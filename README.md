# Codacy Duplication jscpd

This is the duplication docker we use at Codacy to have [jscpd](https://github.com/kucherenko/jscpd) support.
You can also create a docker to integrate the tool and language of your choice!

## Usage

You can create the docker by doing:

```bash
sbt graalvm-native-image:packageBin
docker build -t codacy-duplication-jscpd .
```

You can run the docker with the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -v $srcDir:/src codacy-duplication-jscpd
```

## Test

For a faster development loop you can create a Docker image based on the JVM instead of creating a native-image:

```bash
sbt universal:stage
docker build -t codacy-duplication-jscpd --target dev .
```

We use the [codacy-plugins-test](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-plugins-test) to test our external tools integration.
You can follow the instructions there to make sure your tool is working as expected.
